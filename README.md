# Static Malware Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive script for performing static malware analysis on executable files. It calculates various file hashes, inspects imported DLLs, extracts useful strings and URLs, and integrates with VirusTotal API to check for malicious signatures. The results are compiled into a detailed report saved in a Word document.

## Features

- **Hash Calculation**: Computes MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of the file.
- **DLL Import Inspection**: Lists all imported DLL files used by the executable.
- **String Extraction**: Extracts useful strings, URLs, and file paths from the file.
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Submits the file to VirusTotal for analysis and retrieves detection details.
- **Report Generation**: Creates a detailed static analysis report in Word format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pefile` library
- `hashlib` library
- `requests` library
- `python-docx` library
- `subprocess` module
- `re` module

## Installation

```sh
pip install pefile requests python-docx
```

## Usage
Prepare API Key: Save your VirusTotal API key in a file named api.txt.
Run the Script: Execute the script with the path to the executable file you want to analyze.
Check the Report: The static analysis report will be saved as Static_Analysis_Report.docx.

```sh
python analyze.py
```

## Example use:
```sh
python analyze.py path/to/your/executable.exe
```

## Sample Output:

```
Loading...

Malicious: This file is flagged by antivirus engines of VirusTotal as malicious.

Hashes: MD5 
	Hash: <MD5_HASH> 
	SHA1 Hash: <SHA1_HASH> 
	SHA256 Hash: <SHA256_HASH>

Imported DLL files: 
	KERNEL32.dll 
	USER32.dll 
	ADVAPI32.dll

Static Analysis report has been saved to -> Static_Analysis_Report.docx
